Use K-means clustering to replace pixels in an image

I saw this interesting application of K-means clustering and wanted to try it out myself! 
I see this as sort of creating a minimalist version of an image by replacing all the colours with just a few colours.
* i.e. replacing each colour with a main representative

Another plus side is that it can be used to decrease overall size of image.
